## Planning 




## Approach
The development process began with creating the [backend api](https://github.com/courtneymcodes/meal-app-server). Once the backend was built, I created a new Angular application. I began by creating the components and settting up the file structure. Then I created the url paths in the app-routing.module.ts file and began creating templates. I used Angular's HttpClient to make Http requests to connect the frontend application with the backend. I used [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/courtneymcodes/projects/2/views/1) to help track tasks and my progress during the development process. 


## Future Developments and Bug Fixes

- Add error messages for user

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Run npm install in your terminal 
3. Type ng serve in your terminal to start the server
4. Make sure the backend server is running
